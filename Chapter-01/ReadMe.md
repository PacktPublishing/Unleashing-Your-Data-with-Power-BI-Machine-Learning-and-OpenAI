1. **read_me.xlsx** - This is the Excel file for the reference tables. It can also be downloaded from the FAA Wildlife Strike data website, but this version will always be a match for the version in the book.
2. **wildlife.accdb** - This Access file is a snapshot of the version used for the book. You can also download a newer version from the FAA Wildlife Strike data website.
3. **Chapter 1 Template.pbit** - This is a Power BI template file for the content from Chapter 1. Once you download **read_me.xls** and **wildlife.accdb** you can enter the locations as parameters when you open the file using Power BI Desktop, and it will populate. The file will be contain all the work for Chapter 1, and will be ready to begin Chapter 2.
