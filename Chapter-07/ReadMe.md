## Chapter Seven Resources

Chapter Seven migrates your work from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI cloud service. The artifacts in this GitHub folder represent the completed hands-on work from Chapter 7:

1. **01 Raw Data - Engine Codes.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which imports a list of key values and descriptive information about aircraft engine codes.
2. **02 Raw Data - Aircraft Type.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which imports a list of key values and descriptive information about aircraft types such as airplace, helicopter, etc.
3. **03 Raw Data - Engine Position.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which imports a list of key values and descriptive information about aircraft engine position.
4. **04 Raw Data - Engine Codes Added Data.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which creates new reference values for incident reports that are missing data about engine codes.
5. **05 Raw Data - Aircraft Type Added Data.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which creates new reference values for incident reports that are missing data about aircraft type.
6. **06 Raw Data - Engine Position Added Data.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which creates new reference values for incident reports that are missing data about engine position.
7. **07 Curated Data - Aircraft Type Info.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which cleans up and curates the aircraft type data.
8. **08 Curated Data - Engine Codes Info.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which cleans up and curates the engine codes data.
9. **09 Curated Data - Engine Position Info.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which cleans up and curates the engine position data.
10. **10 Raw Data - Strike Reports.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which imports and stores the historical FAA Wildlife Strike Report data.
11. **11 Curated Data - Strike Reports Info.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which cleans up and adds key values for the historical FAA Wildlife Strike Report data.
12. **12 Date Table.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow with a custom Date table for the project.
13. **13 Predict Damage.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which will be used to predict damage for wildlife strike events using Power BI ML.
14. **14 Predict Size.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which will be used to predict size of wildlife for wildlife strike events using Power BI ML.
15. **15 Predict Height.M** - This M script creates a Power BI dataflow which will be used to predict height of impact for wildlife strike events using Power BI ML.
16. **STRIKE_REPORTS.txt** - This file can be used to import the historical FAA Wildlife Stirke data if a user does not have Microsoft Access.
